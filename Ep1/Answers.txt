Emmet is a toolkit that allows us to create boiler plates through the use of shortcuts. eg use of ! or
html to create html boiler plates.

Library is pre-written and a developer has better control of functions(more like kitchen utensils we decide how to use them) eg react while a framework is an skeleton masking an application and developer has less control.
(more like a recipe template it tells us when and how to)e.g angular

Content Delivery Network- CDN used to host sites in development and production.for testing purposes.

while ReactDOM is used used to identify the root on which react will be rendered also has in-built methods and

<!-- Defer and Async attributes -->
The concepts of Defer and Async attributes in HTML has to do with how html code is run in script tags during download
and execution.
Without async and defer attributes, the scripts blocks html parsing(reading of html line by line) while 
they download and execute and this can slow down page rendering

<!-- async -->
With async attribute scripts downloads without blocking html parsing
Executes immediately when download completes and may interrupt html at execution.
Multiple async scripts may execute in any order (not guaranteed to maintain order)
Best for independent scripts that don't rely on DOM or other scripts

<!-- defer -->
Script downloads in parallel with HTML parsing (non-blocking)
Waits to execute until HTML parsing is completely finished
Multiple deferred scripts execute in the order they appear in the document
Executes before the DOMContentLoaded event

<!-- Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Analytics - can run anytime -->
    <script src="analytics.js" async></script>
    
    <!-- Main app script - needs DOM ready and order -->
    <script src="main.js" defer></script>
    <script src="utils.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>
