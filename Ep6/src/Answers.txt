What is a Microservice?
This is a type of architecture where the application is divided 
into small projects. eg Ul,Backend,Database,Sms,Email,Payment system etc

Advantages of microservice ?
● You work in small teams this makes work more efficient
● Easier to catch bugs (debug)
● Code can be deployed in different ports but will be all linked to one 
  domain name.
● Separation of concerns
● Can use different Tech-stack


What is Monolith architecture?
Monolith is a type of architecture where application is developed 
and deployed as one big project.

Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
We use useEffect() hook Which is a normal javascript function but 
has a special side effect of delaying to perform and action.
typically, we use useEffect to make an API call to backend.
we fetch through the same useEffect() as it accepts 12 parameters

seEffect(()=>{
    fetchData();
},[]);

const fetchData=async()=>{
const data=await fetch(Url to fetch data from);
const json=data.json()

update the local state variable within the function . eg 
setListOfRestraunt(data.json.card.card. etc from Api extraction)
}

What is Optional Chaining?
This is simply adding a .? to nested objects and arrays.
●it prevents runtime errors
●cleaner Code
●Better performance
●improved readability

What is Shimmer UI?
This is just a fake user interface developed to improve the user experience
it displays a fake ul as the Data from Backend/API is being called
just a psycological concept to improve Ux. it is done through
condition or through conditional rendering

if(ListOfRestraunt.length===0){
    return <Shimmer/>
}

Conditional rendering
Rendering based on conditions example is rendering shimmmer ui only
When Api is still fetching data from BE.
eg 
Return 
ListOfRestraunt.length===0 ?
(<Shimmer/>):
(<div className=Body>
<div>
)

What is CORS? cross origin resource sharing is basically
a policy for browsers to only allow sharing between 2 Api calls from the 
same port or same call. otherwise throw an error.
you can fix this by installing a Cors chrome extension
or add CorsProxy to your url/Api which will sort the issue out. CorsProxy will bypass
any restriction given by CORS.

What is async and await?
This is just a new way of handling promises returned from fetch. it is a syntactic sugar  

What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants() ?
it converts the fetched Data into a json file easily understood
by javascript.

What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?
Expression can be evaluated and they produce a value. Any valid Code

Statement does not really produce a value. eg x+5

Declaration introduces a new identifier
